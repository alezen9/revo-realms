# ðŸª© Revo Realms

I started this project to challenge myself â€” to see if I could actually build a game thatâ€™s fun, performant, and visually interesting. But more than that, I started it for my niece.

One day, while I was finishing the final lesson of the Three.js Journey course, she sat next to me and watched me play the game we had just built. She loved it. And something clicked: what if I made something for her â€” and for anyone else â€” to enjoy?

From there, Revo Realms was born. It began as a small idea and slowly turned into a sandbox for me to explore real-time rendering, physics, soft culling, procedural content, and all the beautiful chaos that comes with trying to balance realism and performance â€” something Iâ€™ve grown to deeply respect in AAA development.

It's far from perfect, but it's a solid step toward a dream I've carried for a long time: to build an actual game, "con i controcazzi," as we say in Italian â€” something real, something fun, something people can get lost in.

Originally, I wanted to use it as a sort of interactive portfolio â€” heavily inspired by Bruno Simonâ€™s work, both old and new â€” but who knows what itâ€™ll become. For now, itâ€™s just a fascinating, ever-growing playground.
